# AI-Powered-Invoice-Automation


I'm thrilled to share a project I put together in just 15 minutes this afternoon, demonstrating the incredible speed of modern AI development.

The Problem: How do you process thousands of PDF invoices when each one has a different layout? Manual data entry is slow, expensive, and error-prone.

The Solution: A rapid-development AI pipeline. Leveraging the multimodal capabilities of Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash model within a Google Colab environment, I wrote a Python script that automates the entire workflow. The AI performs advanced Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on scanned PDFs, intelligently identifies the relevant data points (customer, invoice #, totals, VAT etc.), and structures the output into a clean Google Sheet.

What used to take hundreds of man-hours can now be accomplished before your coffee gets cold. This is more than just a proof-of-concept; it's a look into the future of automated financial document processing.
